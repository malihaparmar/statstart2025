#Protein contact maps 
#startstart2025 
#This project focuses on extracting structural information from proteins 
#by computing distance matrices and identifying atomic contacts. 
#We use PDB files as inputs, and generate contact maps and graph 
#representations to visualize interactions between the residues.
